Subject: Complaint regarding water supply in our area

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to bring to your attention the concerning issue of inadequate water supply in our area. I am a resident of [Your Area Name] and have been facing numerous problems due to the lack of proper water supply for the past few months.

Despite several attempts to notify the local authorities and concerned officials, the situation has not improved. The water supply in our area is irregular, and we often have to go without water for days. When the supply does come, it is for a short duration and is inadequate for the basic needs of the residents.

The lack of proper water supply has created many difficulties for the residents in our area. We are forced to depend on expensive private tankers for our daily needs, which is an additional burden on the already strained financial conditions of many households. Moreover, the unclean and contaminated water supplied through tankers has resulted in health hazards for the residents, especially children and the elderly.

The situation becomes worse during the summer months when the demand for water increases. We are facing great difficulties in carrying out our daily chores like cooking, cleaning, and personal hygiene due to the lack of water supply. The students in our area also suffer as they are unable to wash their hands regularly, leading to health concerns.

I would like to request the concerned authorities to take immediate action to address this issue and ensure an uninterrupted water supply in our area. Our repeated complaints and requests seem to have fallen on deaf ears, and we are left with no option but to bring this matter to your notice.

I hope that the concerned authorities will look into this matter seriously and take necessary steps to resolve the water supply issue in our area.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We, the residents of [Your Area Name], trust in your ability to help us and look forward to a quick and positive solution.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
