Subject: Request for Issuance of a Birth Certificate

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing this letter to kindly request the issuance of my birth certificate. My name is [Your Name] and I was born on [Date of Birth] in [City/ Village/ Town Name]. My parent's names are [Parents' Names] and they have been living in [City/ Village/ Town Name] for the past [Number] years.

I have misplaced my original birth certificate and I urgently need it for various official purposes such as applying for a passport, admission to college, and other legal documents. I have attached a photocopy of my old birth certificate for your reference.

I have inquired with the local authorities, but they have informed me that the issuance of a birth certificate is done by the Deputy Commissioner's office. I am aware that it might take some time to process the request, and I would be grateful if you could expedite the process.

I have enclosed all the necessary documents and the required fee along with this letter. If there are any additional documents required, please do let me know and I will provide them at the earliest.

I would be grateful if you could kindly consider my request and issue a new birth certificate at the earliest. I am in urgent need of it, and your quick response would be highly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
