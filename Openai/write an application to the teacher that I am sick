Dear [Teacher’s Name],

I am writing this letter to inform you that I am unable to attend school today as I am not feeling well. I have been experiencing [symptoms] since last night and it has worsened this morning. I visited the doctor and he advised me to take rest at home for a day.

I apologize for the inconvenience and I understand that my absence may disrupt the class schedule. I have requested my classmate to collect the homework/assignments for me so that I can complete them at home. I assure you that I will catch up on anything I missed during today’s class.

I have always been punctual and attentive in class and I do not want to miss out on any important lessons. I will make sure to complete the missed work and submit it on time.

I will keep you informed about my health and will provide a doctor's note upon my return to school. I am hoping to recover quickly and be back in school tomorrow.

Thank you for your understanding and I apologize for any inconvenience caused.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
